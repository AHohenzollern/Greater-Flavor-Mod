grand_tactics;Grand Tactics;;
grand_tactics_desc;Grand tactics, also known as maneuver tactics or minor strategy, was a term related to the maneuvering of troops not currently engaged in combat. It eventually developed into the concept of the operational level of war. The recent Napoleonic Wars had shown how superior speed could be achieved by proper organization of troops and logistics, and how said speed could be used to force battle on advantageous terms.;;
creeping_barrage;Creeping Barrage;;
creeping_barrage_desc;A development of the concept of synchronized heavy support, a creeping barrage was an artillery bombardment that moved along with an attack in a preplanned pattern. Typically, the barrage front would move ahead of the attacking infantry to cover its advance and suppress defenders, then prevent the enemy from reinforcing the attacked front by bombarding reserve lines and expected routes of reinforcement.;;
defense_in_depth;Defense in Depth;;
defense_in_depth_desc;If trench systems with endless layers, reserve lines and fallback positions turned out to be insufficient to stop an attacker, a final resort was to take the whole concept of flexible counterattacks to the operational level. That is, let the attacker advance, wait for the attacker to overextend when trying to exploit the breakthrough, and counterattack. This is largely what happened to the German army on the Western Front of the Great War in 1918. Counterattacks by tanks turned out to be particularly effective, as the German army had outrun its own artillery and had little else at the time to counter tanks with.;;
modern_army_doctrine;Army Motorization;;
air_interdiction;Air Interdiction;;
air_interdiction_desc;Air interdiction is the use of air power to disrupt the enemy operationally. Attacks against rear support functions like logistics, headquarters and communications can reduce the effectiveness of enemy frontline units, while enemy troop movement can be hindered by attacking infrastructure and enemy units moving in marching column along roads.;;
close_air_support;Close Air Support;;
close_air_support_desc;Close air support is the use of air power tactically in support of ground troops, as a battlefield force multiplier. Aircraft thus used are sometimes described as flying artillery, and had the advantage of being able to be rapidly and precisely brought to bear where needed most.;;
motorized_combined_arms_groups;Motorized Combined Arms Groups;;
motorized_combined_arms_groups_desc;The Great War showed the militaries of the great powers the need for capabilities at rapid exploitation of breakthroughs, and for the force doing so to retain combat readiness while doing it rather than overextending itself by outrunning its support elements. The solution was to create entire self-sufficient combined arms groups where every element is motorized and can keep up. Few anticipated at the time that it would not merely provide a counter to the stalemate of trench warfare, but to bring back maneuver warfare into such prominence that such stalemates were unlikely to develop in the first place.;;
motorized_reserves;Motorized Reserves;;
motorized_reserves_desc;Motorization did not only enhance the operational capabilities of attackers, but also brought defenders ways of countering them. Motorized reserves could be used to parry attacks, either by quickly moving in to plug a gap in the frontline or to carry out counterattacks against attackers trying to exploit a breakthrough.;;
spgs_n_assault_guns;Self-Propelled Guns & Assault Guns;;
spgs_n_assault_guns_desc;As motorization brought back maneuver warfare into prominence, motorization of artillery became relevant. Self-propelled guns were able to keep up with motorized forces or be rapidly redeployed as needed, and assault guns were able to provide close direct-fire support to infantry right at the frontline.;;
muzzle_loaded_rifle_armament;Percussion Cap;;
muzzle_loaded_rifle_armament_desc;A percussion cap is a charge made of a highly reactive chemical that will combust upon being hit with sufficient force. A caplock is a firing mechanism using a hammer connected to the trigger striking a percussion cap to ignite the gunpowder charge. While the caplock did not in itself provide a major improvement in performance over the flintlock, its relative mechanical simplicity enabled future developments in gun design.;;
minie_bullet;Minié Bullet;;
minie_bullet_desc; This was a cylindrical bullet with a conical dent at its end, which made it deform outward to cover the entire width of the barrel when fired. Consequently, it could be used in rifled guns without needing a tight fit between bullet and barrel, something that had previously limited the rate of fire of rifled guns and limited their military use. The most prominent muzzle-loading rifles using Minié bullets were the eponymous Minié rifle, the Enfield rifle, the Lorenz rifle and the Springfield rifle.;;
breech_loaded_rifle_armament;Needle Guns;;
breech_loaded_rifle_armament_desc;A needle gun has a firing mechanism design where pulling the trigger released a needle-like firing pin that penetrates a paper cartridge to hit and ignite a percussion cap at the end of the bullet. This allowed for the use of a single breech-loaded cartridge combining bullet, percussion cap and gunpowder charge. The mechanism was first used on the Dreyse needle gun, after which others followed suit.;;
chamber_obturation;Chamber Obturation;;
chamber_obturation_desc;One issue early breech-loading firearms had was the leakage of pressure from the chamber when firing, through air gaps between moving parts. Various mechanics were devised to mitigate the problem. A prominent case was the Chassepot rifle that used a rubber fitting for the purpose.;;
metallic_cartridges;Metallic Cartridges;;
metallic_cartridges_desc;Metallic cartridges offered advantages over the previously used paper cartridges. The metal casing served to direct the force produced by the combustion of gunpowder, as well as contributed to obturation by expanding to cover the inner surfaces of the chamber. The most prominent early rifles to use the metallic cartridge were the Snider-Enfield rifle, the Mauser rifle and the Gras rifle.;;
volley_guns;Volley Guns;;
volley_guns_desc;Multi-barreled volley guns have existed in one form or the other almost as long as guns have, and the 19th century was no exception, the several variants of the Mitrailleuse being the most prominent examples. Precursors to proper machine guns, they could fulfil much the same role, though suffered from the same disadvantage that volley guns always had: Each barrel had to be reloaded separately after all were discharged, making them able to achieve high rates of fire only for short durations.;;
mechanized_reloading;Mechanized Reloading;;
mechanized_reloading_desc;Achieving high sustained rates of fire inevitably required mechanization of the loading process. The first mechanically loaded guns used manually operated cranks or levers to drive the loading mechanism. The most successful such design was the Gatling gun, which used multiple barrels revolving around a central shaft, each barrel being in a different phase of the cycle of loading, firing and ejecting the cartridge.;;
machine_gun_armament;Fully Automatic Fire;;
machine_gun_armament_desc;Automatic firearms operate by using part of the energy released by the combustion of gunpowder to drive the reloading mechanism. The first practical such design was the Maxim gun, which absorbed part of the recoil to drive a reloading mechanism at the breech.;;
bolt_action_rifles;Repeating Rifles;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament;Lever Action;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament_desc;A repeating rifle is a rifle with an internal magazine, allowing several shots to be fired between reloads, with at most a manual action needed by the user between shots to chamber a new cartridge. The first repeating rifles were lever-action rifles, where the cartridges were typically in a tube magazine under the barrel and the chambering done by pulling a lever typically consisting of the trigger guard and a handle behind it by the stock. The Winchester rifle was the most famous and prominent rifle of this kind.;;
bolt_action;Bolt Action;;
bolt_action_desc;The cylindrical rotating bolt had been used already on the first breech-loaded rifles to open and close the breech. The appearance of magazine-fed repeating rifles made bolt action increasingly relevant. The cylindrical bolt could be used to drive the entire mechanism for ejecting a spent cartridge and chambering a new one from the magazine. The magazine was inside the stock just ahead of the trigger, and could be ejected and refilled far more quickly than the tube magazine of a lever action rifle. ;;
modern_divisional_structure;Modern Infantry Weapons;;
light_machine_guns;Light Machine Guns;;
light_machine_guns_desc;The first machine guns were bulky and ill suited for fire and maneuver tactics, and consequently best suited for defense and positional warfare. The solution was the development of lighter machine guns that could be operated by teams of two men, keep pace with riflemen, be set up to fire quickly, and even be fired from the hip on the move. Furthermore, light machine guns were versatile enough to be closely integrated with the riflemen. At the end of the interwar period, the best equipped armies could have as much as one light machine gun per infantry squad.;;
submachine_guns;Submachine Guns;;
submachine_guns_desc;Advances in machine gun design and miniaturization allowed for the mechanism to be adapted to smaller weapons, one of which was the submachine gun. Combining fully automatic fire and being no heavier or less convenient to handle than a carbine, it was a devastating weapon at short ranges, though too short-ranged to be feasible as a general-purpose infantry weapon.;;
flamethrowers;Flamethrowers;;
flamethrowers_desc;The flamethrower was a specialized assault weapon projecting a stream of flaming liquid fuel. It was particularly useful against enemies in confined spaces such as bunkers and fortifications, as it could set entire areas on fire and either flush the enemy out of them or burn them alive. It also had an exceptional psychological shock effect on the enemy on the receiving end of it.;;
man_portable_mortars;Man-Portable Mortars;;
man_portable_mortars_desc;The increasing significance of indirect-fire weapons to deal with enemies behind cover, alongside the increasing subdivision of armies into smaller tactical subunits, led to the development and adoption of man-portable light mortars. Small enough to be carried by one man and operated by a few, they provided a versatile, closely integrated source of fire support for infantry.;;
hand_grenades;Hand Grenades;;
hand_grenades_desc;19th century military thinkers thought that as firefights were happening at ever-increasing ranges due to improvements in gun technology, the hand grenade had become obsolete. However, the proliferation of trenches and the increasing importance of battlefield cover made hand grenades relevant again as a close-range weapon, as they could be thrown at enemies behind cover without having a direct line of fire.;;
heavy_armament_dunno;Modern Artillery;;
clausewitzian_theory;Clausewitzian Theory;;
clausewitzian_theory_desc;This was a subjectivistic view of war in which there where a set of rules of the thumb governing warfare. Particular emphasis was put on dealing with uncertainties inherent in the nature of war, both due to the presence of a multitude of small causes that can make things go wrong (friction), and the incompleteness and unreliability of information available for decision-making (fog of war). The important thing was to break the will of the enemy, as war was considered a continuation of politics by other means, and politics ultimately is a conflict of wills.;;
jominian_theory;Jominian Theory;;
jominian_theory_desc;This was a view of war that essentially treated it as a geometric matter, using concepts such as bases, strategic lines and key points to describe the theatre of war, and considered victory to follow from bringing superior force to the decisive point. ;;
troop_density_studies;Troop Density Studies;;
troop_density_studies_desc;As increases in firepower caused armies to fight in a more dispersed way and open order became the norm even for common line infantry, the issue of proper troop density became a subject of scientific study. Higher troop density allowed for the concentration of force at the cost of increased losses from enemy fire, particularly from enemy artillery. One prominent view that developed was that attacks should be done with a very high temporary density to allow for swiftly overcoming the enemy, then disperse into a lower density before enemy artillery could respond and be brought to bear. ;;
universal_conscription;Universal Conscription;;
universal_conscription_desc;Conscription had been used in one form or the other since the Napoleonic Wars, but most states used it sparingly or selectively, stopping far short of universal male military service. There were concerns that mass conscript armies could turn against the government, swayed by the cause of revolution or ethnic separatism. There were also doubts about the efficiency of mass conscript armies made up of men with relatively little training, so quality of conscripts was largely preferred over quantity. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 turned out to be a watershed moment, showing how capable mass conscript armies can be when properly led and organised. Universal male conscription was introduced in many countries in the following decades. While the concerns about conscript armies turning against the government remained, keeping up in the arms race between great powers was considered more important.;;
army_ordnance_department;Army Ordnance Department;;
army_ordnance_department_desc;For centuries, innovation and adaptation of new weapons had taken place largely in an ad hoc fashion. With the rapid development of weapons technology in the 19th century, this was no longer sufficient, and armies that kept on as before risked being surpassed by their rivals and getting a rude awakening on the battlefield. Instead, permanent agencies were formed for the purpose. Known as ordnance departments, weapons committees and similar terms depending on country, their task was to assess and choose the weapons used by the army. Such agencies helped the army procure weapons fit for purpose, as well as helped weapons inventors and manufacturers by letting them better know what the army wanted and was ready to pay for.;;
work_of_national_importance;Work of National Importance;;
work_of_national_importance_desc;Protracted major wars with mass conscript armies and the labour shortage they caused strained not only the civilian economy, but also the very war economy needed to keep that conscript army in the field. By classifying work into different categories of national importance depending on the needs of the war effort and by planning the manpower allocation for different industries, conscription could be carried out in a way that handled the tradeoff between military and industrial manpower in a more efficient way, allowing for an even larger fraction of the population to be conscripted.;;
infantry_squads;Infantry Squads;;
infantry_squads_desc;As soldiers fought increasingly dispersed and became increasingly reliant on individual initiative, old modes of command and control where entire companies or even battalions would act as single entities became unfit for purpose. The solution was to subdivide them into ever smaller subunits capable of independent action, all the way down to infantry squads consisting of about 7-10 men under the command of an NCO. This expanded the role of NCOs and made them more important than ever, as they now no longer merely served to transmit and enforce the orders of superior officers, but had actual leadership duties in their own right.;;
fire_and_movement;Fire and Movement;;
fire_and_movement_desc;Fire and Movement would develop into the main tactical paradigm of infantry on the battlefield. It was based on the premise that the way to win was to maneuver into positions where the enemy would be maximally exposed to your fire, and the way to do that was to use your own firepower to force the enemy to react and thus be prevented from interfering with your maneuvers. This typically meant having subunits of your force taking turns firing and moving, thus leapfrogging from position to position while keeping the enemy under constant fire. Particular significance was given to suppressive fire in providing cover for maneuver. Fire and movement tactics could be, and were meant to be, used all the way down to the level of the individual soldiers. The time of the traditional soldier drilled to be an unflinching, unthinking cog in the military machine who did nothing but execute specific orders was definitely over.;;

;;;Lancashire Webstuhl
;;;This was the first semi-automatic loom. With a single operator action, it kept weaving until the shuttle ran out of thread. Consequently, a single worker could operate several looms simultaneously, increasing productivity.
;;;Einfachnaht-Nähmaschine
;;;A lockstitch seam is one consisting of two threads on opposite sides of the cloth, held in place by being entwined at each hole made by the needle. It is a simple but very neat and durable seam, and a machine capable of quickly producing one will improve the efficiency of clothing production.

;;;Northrops Mechanischer Webstuhl
;;;This was the first fully automatic loom, improving on earlier semi-automatic looms by adding an automatic loading mechanism to replace empty shuttles without any operator action. It allowed a single worker to operate up to 16 looms at once.
;;;Doppelnaht
;;;The overlock pattern consists of two parallel seams connected by a crisscrossing third seam. It is a very durable pattern. Machines capable of producing such a pattern will efficiently produce clothing of high quality.
