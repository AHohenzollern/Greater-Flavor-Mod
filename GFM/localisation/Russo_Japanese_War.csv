russo_japanese_war_title;Ambush the Russian Fleet in Port Arthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_desc;Tension has been roiling between Japan and Russia for some time as both nations have attempted to consolidate military and economic footholds in Korea and northern China. This rivalry cannot stay peaceful any longer. We must defeat Russia in war if we shall ever become the masters of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_japanese_treaty_title;A Treaty with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_japanese_treaty_desc;Russia's resounding defeat in our war with them leaves us with leverage to make harsh demands toward them. Let's decide which territory to take from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_russian_treaty_title;A Treaty with Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_russian_treaty_desc;Japan attacked us without warning, and now they suffer the consequences of their defeat and humiliation. Let us take the chance to negotiate what territory we can take from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784518;Japan ambushes the Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784518;Diplomatic tension with Japan has been increasing steadily over time, as both of us continue contending for dominance in East Asia. That diplomatic tension has now reached the breaking point. The Japanese fleet launched a surprise attack on our Pacific fleet, docked at Port Arthur. They intend to make war to decide who shall be Asia's true master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784519;We are winning against Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVTDESC784519;With Port Arthur occupied, we have the upper hand against the Russian army! With their troops hopelessly forced to traverse the harsh Siberian terrain to reach us, they are easy targets for our dug-in soldiers. With their defeat in sight, perhaps they may be open to a peace treaty right now. The choice is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784520;Japan offers us peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784520;Our troops are battered, and the Japanese are obviously at an advantage against us. They have therefore taken this opportunity to sue for peace. They demand Port Arthur and any portion of Sakhalin and the Kurils that we own. Should we accept this offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784521;Russia accepts our peace offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784521;The war with Russia is over. They have accepted our generous peace terms, with our new territorial acquisitions effective immediately. Today is a good day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784522;Russia rejects our peace offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784522;Despite our clear advantage, Russia still has more fight left in them. They will have to be persuaded further to submit to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784523;We are winning against Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784523;The dastardly Japanese have failed to make a meaningful advance, despite their initial ambush on our navy. If they stagnate any longer, or start losing more battles, they could realize that victory is futile. Maybe we should save them time and propose peace right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784524;Russia offers us peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784524;We failed to advance after our initial attack on Russia. Victory is starting to fade from the realm of possibility. Russia, however, has been generous enough to offer us peace right now. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784525;Japan accepts our peace offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784525;The Japanese are tired of this war's slow burn. They agreed to cede their portion of Sakhalin to us. We imagine they won't be challenging us in the Far East again any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784526;Japan refuses our peace offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784526;Japan foolishly clings on to the hope that they can turn this war's tide. How much more bloodshed will it take for them to understand their error?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784527;A harsher treaty with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784527;We now have the ability to demand more territory from Russia than we initially hoped for. Whichever choice we make, it will cripple Russia's presence in East Asia and the Pacific. What shall we demand? (Please note that any choices taken that involve annexing Asian colonies Russia does not own will not work. You will simply gain more infamy for nothing.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784528;Japan makes its peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784528;Japan demands all of Sakhalin, the Kurils, Outer Manchuria, and any of our East Asian territories. We are obligated to grant them this land, now that the war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784529;Japan makes a harsh peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784529;Japan demands all of our Far Eastern territory up to Magadan as well as any East Asian territory. This will block Russia from having a coastline within the Pacific. Nevertheless, we are obligated to give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784530;Japan's bold peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784530;Japan demands all of the Russian Far East, up to Trans-Baikal, as well as any East Asian territory. All of eastern Siberia will become Japanese. They are driving a hard bargain for a vanquished enemy such as us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784531;A harsher treaty with Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784531;We now have the ability to demand more territory from Japan than we initially hoped for. Whichever choice we make, it will cripple Japan's strategic position in East Asia, making expansion much more difficult for them. What shall we demand? (Please note that any choices taken that involve annexing Asian colonies Japan does not own will not work. You will simply gain more infamy for nothing.);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784532;Russia makes its peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784532;Russia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, and Tsushima. They intend to cut us off from expanding into continental Asia. We, of course, are obligated to grant them their wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784533;Russia makes a harsh peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784533;Russia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Tsushima, and Taiwan. They intend to cut us off from expanding into continental Asia. We, of course, are obligated to grant them their wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784534;Russia's bold peace offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784534;Russia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Tsushima, and any and all Korean and Chinese territories. We will no longer have any leverage on the continent, further geographically isolating our islands. But it's not like we have a choice in this treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784535;Taiwan annexed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784535;This event confirms that Taiwan has fallen into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ hands. Additional infamy will be incurred for the annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784536;All Japanese Chinese/Korean colonies annexed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784536;This event confirms that all formerly Japanese-controlled territories on the East Asian continent have been annexed to $COUNTRY$. Additional infamy will be incurred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784537;Russian Alaska annexed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784537;This event confirms that Alaska, previously under Russian control, has been annexed to $COUNTRY$. Since Russia no longer has a continental coastline in the Pacific, it only makes sense we'd take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aggression_against_russia;Aggression against Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aggression_against_russia_desc;We are fighting an offensive war against Russia, intending to push them out of East Asia and the Pacific. This modifier will expire after 580 days of the Russo-Japanese War's start. If Port Arthur is taken and held by us for longer than 30 days by then, we will be able to sue for peace. If not, Russia can make demands from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
