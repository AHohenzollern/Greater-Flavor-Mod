KAUTOKEINO;The Kautokeino Uprising of 1852!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
KAUTOKEINODESC;67 Samis lead by Aslak Hætta had rebelled in Kautokeino killing 2 Norwegians! This was apparently because their family was imprisoned for not meeting up for the obligatory religious service we have kindly provided to them to make them civilized, instead they'd rather listen to the teachings of the controversial heretic, Lars Levi Læstadius who's trying to stop honest Norwegian merchants from selling alcohol to the Sami population. Oh and also, they feel "badly treated" because we're trying to civilize them by giving us our beautiful language and religion. How ungrateful! Prime minister, what is your stance on this matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACCEPTSAMI;We need to share the nation with the Samis!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REJECTSAMI;We will not give up until they submit! (Historical);;;;;;;;;;;;x
