greater_norway_desc;After the rise of romantic nationalism in Norway spanning from 1840 to 1865, the term "Norgesveldet" swept through the country reminding people of how great Norway used to be on the map! We colonized Iceland, we colonized Greenland and legend even has it that we even colonized Newfoundland before anyone else! Sweden robbed us of our past territories and our old deal with Novgorod to split the northern Nordics is invalid as Novgorod no longer exists. It's time to step away from the sidelines and once again become the great power our beautiful country deserves to be! The time has come to re-establish Norgesveldet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jemtland_rename_title;Welcome back the people of Jämtland and Bohuslän;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jemtland_rename_desc;The Swedes have been tricking Norwegians living in Jemtland and Båhuslen for too long. Heck, they don't even speak any Swedish, but rather Norwegian! It's time to welcome home our lost brothers in western Sweden who didn't even get Swedish citizenship before 1699 We tried to conquer the province back in 1677 and we were hailed as liberators by all of Jemtland, but the people need not fear anymore, because they're home now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iceland_rename_title;Welcome back the north atlantic islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iceland_rename_desc;We've finally taken back what were robbed from us during the "Treaty of Kiel". The Icelanders have been gone from us for too long to keep the Norwegian identity at its fullest but there's still hope for the Faroese who arguably still speak a variant of the "Landsmål Norwegian" ("Nynorsk" today).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hebrides_rename_title;Welcome back the Hebrides;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hebrides_rename_desc;These are territory we've lost during the middle ages. We even colonized them and the Brits have forcefully assimilated OUR people. The people living there may speak English, but they still got our blood and heritage in them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
newfoundland_rename_title;Welcome back Newfoundland and centralize Labrador;;;;;;;;;;;;x
newfoundland_rename_desc;Technically, we never owned neither Newfoundland nor Labrador but WE discovered it. We discovered the whole continent for damn's sake! We traded and mingled with the natives before England even was a thing! It's about time we reconquered it. Markland is filled with native americans and would never feel Norwegian no matter what we do. We need to banish them and invite Norwegian fishers already living in Canada and promise Norwegians free land and quality of life in Markland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kola_rename_nor_title;Welcome back the Kola peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kola_rename_nor_desc;The Kola peninsula used to be a part of our tax domain but 1326, we signed a treaty with Novgorod splitting the area in 2. We got Finnmark, and they got Kola. Novgorod doesn't exist anymore making the treaty invalid! It's time to finally take back what's ours and improve the fishing industry in the area!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kola_rename_rus_title;Kola Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kola_rename_rus_desc;We have retaken Kola from the Scandinavians, it is time to reintegrate it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
KAUTOKEINO;The Kautokeino Uprising of 1852!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
KAUTOKEINODESC;On the 8th of november 1852, 67 Samis lead by Aslak Hætta had rebelled in Kautokeino killing 2 Norwegians and burning down buildings! This was apparently because their family was imprisoned for not meeting up for the obligatory religious service we have kindly provided to them to make them civilized, instead they'd rather listen to the teachings of the controversial heretic, Lars Levi Læstadius who's trying to stop honest Norwegian merchants from selling alcohol to the Sami population. Oh and also, they feel "badly treated" because we're trying to civilize them by giving them our beautiful language and religion. How ungrateful people! Statsminister, what is your stance on this matter? We can implement Sami as a co-language to gain further support, should we ever for some reason conquer Finnish, Swedish or Russian territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACCEPTSAMI;We need to share the nation with the Kvens and the Samis!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REJECTSAMI;Outragous! We will NOT give up until they submit! (Historical);;;;;;;;;;;;x
fornorskningspolitikk;We are actively repressing Sami culture;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sapmi_rename_title;Reclaim the heartland of the Sami people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sapmi_rename_desc;After our acceptance of the Sami people, we honor them by naming our 2 new provinces after the Sami language. Afer-all, having Sami has a recognized language would never work if we don't promote them aswell, though if we ever own the Kola peninsula, it would be assigned for the Norwegian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_INDEPENDENCE; The Norwegian monarchy referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_INDEPENDENCE_DESC;Unionsoppløsningen (the dissolving of the union) is finally here! After hundreds of years of oppression, we're finally ready to show the world what we're worthy of, but to do that, we need to establish a government. 74% of our people have voted for a monarchy, the rest voted for republic. Whatever we choose, I think the people will be happy nevertheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_REPUBLIC;Establish a republic for the people! Monarchies have toyed with us for long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_MONARCHY;A constitutional monarchy to protect both tradition and democracy! (historical);;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_ABSOLUTE_MONARCHY;We need a king with firm control to maintain Norway's independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nor_declare_independence_title;Declare independence from Sweden!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nor_declare_independence_desc;Time has come to peacefully end this useless union. Romantic nationalism has gone to the point that the people are demanding independence. Sweden trades more with Prussia and we trade more with the UK, thus geo-politically, we have nothing in common with Sweden. Sweden knew this would come sooner or later and historically never had plans on going to war if Norway declared independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nor_lang_decision_title;Time to take a stance in the language debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nor_lang_decision_desc;At the time, we have 3 written languages our people use. The upper class and the politicians uses Danish, the easterners uses Bokmål and the westerners and northerners uses Nynorsk. Our huge dialectal and sociolectal differences makes this hopeless. Our people can barely understand eachother and some can't!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_LANG;Time has come to decide the main language for Norway;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOR_LANG_DESC;Ivar Aasen (left) is the spokesperson for his so-called "real Norwegian" being based on the language people in the countryside speak but he especially represents western Norway. Knud Knudsen (right) is the spokesperson for the Danish-influenced Norwegian often spoken by the upper class, the urban population and generally in eastern Norway. Aasen's variant is known as Landsmål/Nynorsk and Knudsen's variant is known as Riksmål/Bokmål. Aasen released his first dictionary in 1848 and Knudsen released his first dictionary in 1862. If we choose to let each school pick between the two variants, almost everyone will be happy, but if we choose either of them, we can precisely decide what the Norwegian language stands for!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIKSMAAL;Knud Knudsen's Riksmål with Danish influence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LANDSMAAL;Ivar Aasen's Landsmål with Norse inspiration!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LANDSMAAL_AND_RIKSMAAL;Both is equally Norwegian!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
