kni_pap_reconcile_title;Reconcile with Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_pap_reconcile_desc;After Malta was captured in 1798, the knights were dispersed across Europe. After failing to find a home elsewhere across Italy, the Order moved permanently to Rome in 1834. Now, with sovereignty restored in Malta, it is time to welcome those exiles home. Doing so, with some grace to His Holiness, will welcome Malta onto the world stage once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_title;Reconcile with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_desc;After the fall of Malta in 1798, the Russian Emperor Paul I graciously gave a large number of knights shelter in Saint Petersburg. The refugee knights even elected the Tsar as their Grand Master. Now, with the Knights restored to Malta, we must attempt to reconcile with the Tsars and gain back our treasure and prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_event_title;An offer from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_event_desc;An offer from the Knights of Malta. After the fall of Malta in 1798, the Russian Emperor Paul I graciously gave a large number of knights (and some priceless artefacts) shelter in Saint Petersburg. Now, with the Knights Hospitaller regaining sovereignty in Malta, they are asking for the treaure back, and for the rejoining of their refugee comrades back to Malta. This will cost us nothing, but we could humiliate them by refusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_accepted_event_title;Russia accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_accepted_event_desc;Russia has accepted our offer. This is a tremendous boon for our nation, and perhaps we have gained a powerful friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_rejected_event_title;Russia declines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_rejected_event_desc;We were fools to ever think Russia would return the treasure. We have been humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_mlt_title;Become Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_mlt_desc;The time has come to abandon the devotion to this outdated mode of a nation. Let us firmly restructure our country, putting the Maltese people first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mlt_become_kni_title;Become the Knights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mlt_become_kni_desc;Whatever Malta represented hasn't worked out for us. We've become weak and insecure. It's time to restore our rightful place and readopt the Knights Hospitaller into all levels of government. Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_theocracy;Be a theocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_theocracy;If you're seeing this decision, you've probably had to play as the UK, then release and play as the Knights. This decision exists so you can get rid of the constitutional monarchy that you've been forced into and instead adopt a theocratic government a military order deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
