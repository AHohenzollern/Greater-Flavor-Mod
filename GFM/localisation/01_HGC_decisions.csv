support_january_uprising_desc;After Martial Law was declared, those designated for conscription secretly fled from Warsaw (Jan. 14–15, 1863), sought refuge in the nearby woodlands, and on January 22 issued a manifesto calling for a national insurrection. Although they were greatly outnumbered, poorly equipped, and successful in only a few engagements, the rebels gained support among the artisan, worker, lower gentry, and official classes in the cities and stimulated peasant revolts against the large landlords in rural areas. We could support this uprising against the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

finnish_diet_desc;Not until June 1863, after the Crimean War had taken place, did Alexander II call the Finnish Diet again. On September 18 the opening ceremony was held and the Emperor made his declaration where he promised to introduce changes to the constitution. The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867. The result was greater Finnish Autonomy within the Russian Empire and a improvement in the relations of the Finnish Parliament and the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. "The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

switch_to_russian_intelligentsia_desc;The Crimean War awakened the new Russian emperor Alexander II (who succeeded Nicholas I in March 1855) to the need to overcome Russia's backwardness in order to compete successfully with the other European powers. At the same time, the Russian educated elite was living a cultural, political and technological flourishing. This elite was divided into Slavophiles and Westernizers, according to their views on the path Russia should take in the future, and the social class they represented was called intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
